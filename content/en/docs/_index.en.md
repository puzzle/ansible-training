Welcome to the Puzzle Ansible Techlab. This is an
introductory course for getting to know the
basics of the Ansible configuration management
system.

### Target Audience

This course is targeting Linux system administrators
with working knowledge of Linux that did not yet have
exposure to the Ansible configuration management
system. A familiarity with the basic concept of
configuration management is not a prerequisite.


### Techlab Setup

This Ansible techlab assumes that each participant has a
cluster of virtual machines available. Namely:

* a control host
* two Linux nodes called `node1` and `node2`

The cloud-based lab infrastructure is provided if you
are following a guided Techlab by Puzzle ITC.

If you prefer to run the techlab environment locally
you can find instructions to set up Vagrant-based
virtual hosts in the [setup section](/setup)
of this website.

If you already have a setup or the instructor provided
a ready-made one, you may skip ahead to

title: 4.2 Ansible Playbooks - Templates
weight: 42
sectionnumber: 4.2
---

In this lab we start to use templates!

### Task 1

* Rewrite your playbook `motd.yml` without using the `ansible.builtin.copy` module,
but rather using the `ansbile.builtin.template` module.
* Use a Jinja2 template file called `motd.j2` which uses the variable `motd_content`.

{{% details title="Solution Task 1" %}}

Create the file `motd.j2` with the following one-liner:

```bash
$ cat motd.j2
{{ motd_content }}
```

Edit your `motd.yml` playbook to something like this:

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: set content of /etc/motd
      ansible.builtin.template:
        src: motd.j2
        dest: /etc/motd
        mode: "0644"
```

Run the playbook again.
```bash
 ansible-playbook motd.yml -l node1,node2
```
{{% /details %}}

### Task 2

* Improve the template `motd.j2` by adding the default IP address of the server to the template.
* Add information about the installed operating system to the `motd` file as well.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="info" %}}
  Remember using the `ansible.builtin.setup` module to get a list of all facts! Ensure, that gather_facts was set to true.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% details title="Solution Task 2" %}}

Add IP and OS to `motd.j2`:

```bash
$ cat motd.j2
{{ motd_content }}
IP ADDRESS: {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}
OS:         {{ ansible_os_family }}
```

Rerun the playbook and check if the text has been changed accordingly:

```bash
ansible-playbook motd.yml -l node1,node2
ansible all -a "cat /etc/motd"
```
{{% /details %}}

### Task 3 (Advanced)

Create a variable `users` like the following:

```yaml
users:
  - name: jim
    food: pizza
  - name: sabrina
    food: burger
  - name: hans
    food: vegan
  - name: eveline
    food: burger
  - name: santos
```
Put the variable in an appropriate place of your choice.

Create a playbook `userplay.yml` doing the following and running on `node1` and `node2`:

* On `node1`: Create a file `/etc/dinner.txt` with the content below by using the `ansible.builtin.template` module:
  ```
  <name_of_user> <food_for_user>
  ```
* On `node1`: There should be an entry in the file `/etc/dinner.txt` for each user in the variable `users`.
Use a for loop in the template.
* On `node1`: If a user has no food specified, use "kebab".
Look for `filters` in the online docs.
You should be familiar with searching the online docs by now.
* On `node2`: The same playbook `userplay.yml` should create a (Linux) group
for every different food specified in the variable `users`.
If a user has no food defined, create the group "kebab" instead.
* On `node2`: Create a user for every entry in the `users` variable.
Ensure that this user is also in the group with the same name as his food.
Again, if no food is defined for this user, add group "kebab".

#### Bonus 1

* On `node2`: Set the login shell to `/bin/zsh` for all users.

#### Bonus 2

* On `node2`: If (and only if) the user is "santos", disable login.
Do this by setting santos' login shell to `/usr/sbin/nologin`.
Use an if/else statement in the template for that purpose.

#### Bonus 3

* All on `node2`:
  * Set the default password for all the newly created users to "`N0t_5o_s3cur3`"
  * Once the password has been set, your playbook should not set it again. Not even when it got changed.
  * Hash the password using the sha512 algorithm.
  * Donâ€™t define a salt for the password.
  * Verify that you are able to log in as one of the users via SSH providing the password.

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
Be aware that it is NOT a good idea to set passwords in clear text.
We will learn in the lab about `ansible-vault` how to handle this in a better way.
Never ever do this in a productive environment.

```bash
$ pwd
/home/ansible/techlab

$ cat uservars.yml
users:
  - name: jim
    food: pizza
  - name: sabrina
    food: burger
  - name: hans
    food: vegan
  - name: eveline
    food: burger
  - name: santos

$ cat userplay.yml
---
- hosts: node1
  become: true
  vars_files:
    - uservars.yml
  tasks:
    - name: put template
      ansible.builtin.template:
        src: user_template.j2
        dest: /etc/dinner.txt
        mode: "0644"

- hosts: node2
  become: true
  vars_files:
    - uservars.yml
  tasks:
    - name: create groups
      ansible.builtin.group:
        name: "{{ item.food | default('kebab') }}"
      loop: "{{ users }}"
    - name: ensure zsh is installed
      ansible.builtin.dnf:
        name: zsh
        state: installed
    - name: create users
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
        group: "{{ item.food | default('kebab') }}"
        append: true
        shell: "{% if item.name == 'santos' %}/usr/sbin/nologin{% else %}/usr/bin/zsh{% endif %}"
        password: "{{ 'N0t_5o_s3cur3' | password_hash('sha512') }}"
        update_password: on_create
      loop: "{{ users }}"

$ cat user_template.j2
{% for person in users %}
{{ person.name }}               {{ person.food | default('kebab') }}
{% endfor %}
```

{{% alert title="Tip" color="info" %}}
 See the `ansible.builtin.user` module for how to set the password and search for a link to additional documentation
 about how to set passwords in Ansible.
 Note, that it would be even better to create a hash of the password beforehand
 and then set the hash in the task above and not create it in the task itself.
 Reason being the above would result in a state `changed` everytime it runs and is therefore not idempotent.
 You can find in the documentation mentioned how to get the hash in advance.
{{% /alert %}}

Run the playbook, then check on `node1` (as user `root`) if everything is as expected:

```bash
# cat /etc/dinner.txt
jim         pizza
sabrina     burger
hans        vegan
eveline     burger
santos      kebab
```

Check as well on `node2` (as user `root`):
```bash
# grep  'jim\|sabrina\|hans\|eveline\|santos' /etc/passwd
jim:x:1002:1002::/home/jim:/usr/bin/zsh
sabrina:x:1003:1003::/home/sabrina:/usr/bin/zsh
hans:x:1004:1004::/home/hans:/usr/bin/zsh
eveline:x:1005:1003::/home/eveline:/usr/bin/zsh
santos:x:1006:1005::/home/santos:/usr/sbin/nologin

# grep  'pizza\|burger\|vegan\|kebab' /etc/group
pizza:x:1002:
burger:x:1003:
vegan:x:1004:
kebab:x:1005:
```

Login to `node2` as user `jim`, providing the password via SSH prompt:
```bash
ssh -l jim <IP address of node2>
jim@192.168.122.31's password:
```

### Task 4 (Maester)

Create a playbook `serverinfo.yml` that does the following:

* On all nodes: Place a file `/root/serverinfo.txt` with a line like the following repeated for
each and every server in the inventory:

```
<hostname>: OS: <operating system> IP: <IP address> Virtualization Role: <hardware type>
```

* Replace `hostname`, `operating system`, `IP address` and `hardware type` with a reasonable fact.
* Run your playbook and check on all servers by using an `ansible` ad hoc command
if the content of the file `/root/serverinfo.txt` is as expected.

* Are you an Ansible Maester already? Solve the solution once by using a template and once without using a template!

{{% details title="Solution Task 4" %}}
Possible solution 1:
```bash
$ cat serverinfo.txt.j2
{% for host in groups['all'] %}
{{ hostvars[host].ansible_hostname }}: OS: {{ hostvars[host].ansible_os_family }} IP: {{ hostvars[host].ansible_default_ipv4.address }} Virtualization Role: {{ hostvars[host].ansible_virtualization_role }}
{% endfor %}

$ cat serverinfo.yml
---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: put serverinfo.txt
      ansible.builtin.template:
        src: serverinfo.txt.j2
        dest: /root/serverinfo.txt
        mode: "0640"
```
{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
 Have a good look at where to set quotes and where not!
 `hostvars[host]` without the quotes around `host` is not really intuitive.
 More about that in the [FAQ](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/faq.html#how-do-i-loop-over-a-list-of-hosts-in-a-group-inside-of-a-template).
{{% /alert %}}

Possible solution 2:
```bash
$ cat serverinfo.yml
---
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: create the serverinfo file to be distributed later
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /home/ansible/techlab/serverinfo.txt
        state: touch
        mode: "0644"

- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: fill in stuff to local serverinfo.txt
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        path: /home/ansible/techlab/serverinfo.txt
        regexp: "^{{ ansible_hostname }}"
        line: "{{ ansible_hostname }}: OS: {{ ansible_os_family }} IP: {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }} Virtualization Role: {{ ansible_virtualization_role }}"
      delegate_to: localhost

- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: place the file serverinfo.txt
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        src: /home/ansible/techlab/serverinfo.txt
        dest: /root/serverinfo.txt
        mode: "0640"

$ ansible-playbook serverinfo.yml
$ ansible all -b -a "cat /root/serverinfo.txt"
```

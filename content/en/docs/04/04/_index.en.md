In this lab weâ€™ll have a short glimpse at how ansible-pull works.

### Task 1

* Search `docs.ansible.com` for information about the ansible-pull command.
* Look for a way to execute a playbook using ansible-pull
* Search for an example playbook

### Task 2

On node1:

* Install all needed packages to use ansible-pull
* Use an `ansible-pull` command that uses the resources in the folder `resources/ansible-pull/`
of our GitHub repository located at `https://github.com/puzzle/ansible-techlab`.
This command should do the following:
  * Apply the playbook `local.yml` located at the `resource/ansible-pull` folder
  and run it on all hosts in the inventory file `hosts`
  * Show the content of `/etc/motd` and verify, that the file was copied using ansible-pull
  * Also verify, that no content of the git repository was copied to the local folder.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="info" %}}
Note the following:

* If no playbook is specified, ansible-pull looks for a playbook `local.yml`.
* The location of files given as parameters to the ansible-pull command are always relative to the top level
of the git repository.
* All information to run the ansible-pull command is taken from the git repository
(playbook, inventory, MOTD-file to be copied).
No local configuration is used!

```bash
sudo dnf install -y ansible
/usr/bin/ansible-pull -U https://github.com/puzzle/ansible-techlab -i resources/ansible-pull/hosts resources/ansible-pull/local.yml
cat /etc/motd
ll #no file here...
```

### Task 3

It's a best practice to use cronjobs to trigger `ansible-pull` run at a regular basis. Do the following on node1:

* Create a cronjob `/etc/cron.d/ansible-pull`.
This cronjob should run every minute as user ansible the ansible-pull command from Task 2.
* Now remove the existing `/etc/motd` file and use the command `watch` to show the content of `/etc/motd` every second.
We want to observe that our cronjob runs the `ansible-pull` command again and restore the previously deleted MOTD-file.

```bash
$ sudo vim /etc/cron.d/ansible-pull #create the file with the content ->
$ cat /etc/cron.d/ansible-pull
* * * * * ansible /usr/bin/ansible-pull -U https://github.com/puzzle/ansible-techlab -i resources/ansible-pull/hosts resources/ansible-pull/local.yml
$ sudo rm -f /etc/motd; watch -n 1 cat /etc/motd
```

### Task 4

This task has nothing to do with `ansible-pull`, we just clean up the ansible-pull configurations.
Create a playbook `revert_motd.yml` that runs on node1. It should:

* uninstall ansible
* remove the cronjob `/etc/cron.d/ansible-pull`
* empty the file `/etc/motd`

Run the playbook.

```bash
$ cat revert_motd.yml

- hosts: node1
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: uninstall ansible
      ansible.builtin.dnf:
        name: ansible
        state: absent
    - name: ensure cronjob not present
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /etc/cron.d/ansible-pull
        state: absent
        mode: "0640"
    - name: ensure MOTD file empty
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        content: ""
        dest: /etc/motd
        mode: "0640"

$ ansible-playbook revert_motd.yml
```
